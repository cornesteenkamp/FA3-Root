                        Welcome back to my website. If your new, welcome to my world! You may be wondering who I am? My name is Corné Steenkamp. I come from a small town called “Vanrhynsdorp” and went to school at High School Vredendal. One of my main subjects were CAT. When HTML came along in our subject, I immediately knew that I wanted to go deeper in this sort of field. I am currently studying at CTU Training Solutions. I will hopefully be getting a diploma in UI Design and UX Development. Currently, I am looking for colleges to get my degree in Film and Photography. Once I receive my diploma, I will then personalize in Web Design and Development. I can then create websites, manage social media platforms, edit photos, edit videos, and many more for companies. I love working for different companies and people each day. It is the main reason I chose this to study, because even tough I am still studying, I still learn something new each day with this sort of degree. Lets just say my job won't ever get boring and is definitely not the same thing every day. Another thing I love about my studies, I can easily mix it with my other passion, as I mentioned is photography. Because with this job I have to add photos to websites or to people’s social media. That is how I sometimes take my chance to do some photoshoots. I also love working with people and hearing what new ideas they bring into our world as Web Developers and Designers. It is like I said: “Lets just say my job can never get boring and is definitely not the same thing every day.

                                As I mentioned my name is Corné Steenkamp. I am currently 20 years old. I am from a farm, which is outside a small town, called “Vanrhynsdorp” I went to High School Vredendal and matriculated in the year 2021. One of my main subjects were CAT. When HTML came along in our subject, I immediately knew that I wanted to go deeper in this sort of field. I came to Stellenbosch in 2022 where I am still studying  at CTU Training Solutions. I will hopefully be getting a diploma in UI Design and UX Development. Currently, I am looking for colleges to get my degree in Film and Photography. Something that I am also very passionate about. I love meeting new people and to learn something new each day. Basically I like taking on tasks that challenge me. As my mom says: “You are a go-getter” That couldn’t be more true. That is why I love my job and what I am also studying at the moment, because with this field you always do something different each day.
