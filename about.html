                        <h2>WHERE I GREW UP?</h2>
                        <p>
                            As every person on this planet, we all come from somewhere. Also known as “Home” From the day I can remember, I have lived in the countryside my whole life. I would not have wanted it any other way. Our farm is part of Urionskraal Farmery, which is about 25 kilometers outside the small town “Vanrhynsdorp” Where I come from, everyone knows everyone, we help each other when we are in need, are there for each other through hard times, kind of like a big family. I wouldn’t say I am your everyday country girl that people would expect. Because I have a huge love for the city and for the town that I am studying in. I think I would just love to see more places one day. But it is my favorite part about studying, about coming home after months of studying in a totally different place. And then to come home and just be with my family. The countryside will always be special. As I mentioned one of my other passions is Photography. I picked up my first camera back in 2017. It took a lot of snapping photos, experimenting, finding my style, and taking really ugly photos but I found my form of Photography.

    <h2>MY HOBBIES AND INTERESTS?</h2>
    
    <p>
        Everybody else who studies after school as a student knows the pros and cons of being a student. Going out with your friends and trying to be a social butterfly is not always very practical throughout the year. Don’t get me wrong, my first year as a UI Student definitely taught me what time management is. But sometimes the pressure of getting everything done , can get a little too much sometimes. Luckily I have something that helps me get through out each day and helps with my stress levels. It’s called WORKING OUT. I put on my first pair of running shoes in the year 2018, and I never regretted that moment once in my life. To this day, I have a solid workout plan. It includes jogging long distances, cardio, weight lifting, and many more. All my social media accounts are basically just fitness accounts and fitness influencers who actually know what they’re talking about. Running and other forms of cardio are my way of clearing my head, staying healthy, charging before I get my day started, building a better version of myself each day, and feeling good in general.

    <h2>WHERE DO I SEE MYSELF IN 10 YEARS?</h2>
    
    <p>
        Where to I see myself in 10 years? This question is always very difficult to answer. But I think my answer will most likely be like the following. Preferably I would like to see myself having the job I love, hopefully married, living in my dream city, have a few more diplomas behind my name and most importantly, financially stable to survive on my own. I know these might sound far fetched but it does not hurt anyone to dream. If you put your mind to it and just keep working, anything is possible. Ans so many successful people has showed to me that it is true. The following quote from Emma Coburn is something that I will always remember when things seem impossible to me. “BE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU HAVE. WORK HARD FOR WHAT YOU DON’T HAVE” Personally I think it is great to really think about these types of questions somewhere along your life because it is also a way to see if you have to correct end goals set out for your life one day. It will help to keep focus and work towards it.

    <h2>WHAT ARE MY GOALS?</h2>
    
    <p>
        What are my goals? The first few things coming to my head is at this moment in my life is the following. To successfully finish my second year as a UI and UX Student at CTU Training Solutions. I want to receive my diploma for these two years. Hopefully I can be working at a well established company in my field that will also give me the freedom to even travel one day. And one last goal would be very cheesy, but be happy with my life and the end job I will have. This question is almost the same as the one before. Those answers I would also include here. Preferably I would like to see myself having the job I love, hopefully married, living in my dream city, have a few more diplomas behind my name and most importantly, financially stable to survive on my own. I know these might sound far fetched but it does not hurt anyone to dream.
